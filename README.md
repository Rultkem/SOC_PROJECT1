Searches through authentication logs and network logs, to see if any failed passwords attempts have happened and if so how many attempts from which ip. Then summarizes the result in a dashboard with risk evaluation and more. Further an alerts.txt doc is created containing the results as well as the MITRE ATT&amp;CK technique id of the detection.
